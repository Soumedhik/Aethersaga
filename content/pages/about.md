AetherSaga AI is the applied research group born out of [Sister Nivedita University](https://snuniv.ac.in) where faculty, researchers, and students gather to imagine friendlier, smarter machines.
We care about translating rigorous AI breakthroughs into tangible, community-focused impact.

We advance the frontier of artificial intelligence by developing systems that not only process information but also acquire, reason with, and co-design tools with partners invested in education, healthcare, and sustainable cities.

If you want the receipts, wander through our [publications](/publications), meet the humans behind the work on [people](/people), explore the messy builds on our [projects](/projects) page, or slide over to [join](/join) when you are ready to collaborate.
